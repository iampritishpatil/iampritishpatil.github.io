My name is Pritish Patil. 


# my history

I am a graduate student with Ofer Yizhar and Misha Tsodyks at the Weizmann Institute of Science. I am interested in understanding how the brain processes information and how it gives rise to behavior. I am particularly interested in the role of subcellular compartments in shaping neuronal computation. I am also interested in the role of neuromodulators in shaping the dynamics of neural circuits. I've spent the last few years developing and applying new optogenetic tools to study these questions in the mouse brain.

# my journey

I started my scientific journey as an undergraduate student at the Indian Institute of Science Bangalore. I then did my Masters at Weizmann Institute of Science to work with [Ofer Yizhar](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/brain-sciences/labs/yizhar/) and [Misha Tsodyks](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/brain-sciences/labs/tsodyks/home) on understanding the role of inhibitory interneuron subtypes in working memory. I am currently a doing a PhD in the same labs.
