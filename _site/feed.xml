        <description>&lt;p&gt;Now I can strike an item off my new years resolutions list. Not that I have a list. Not that this was a big item. I just started a blog. Yay!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the easy part though. Creating a blog is barely the hard part. The hard part is to write regularly, and about things one cares about. Lets see how that goes. I plan to use this blog to keep track of things I do in life, my thoughts about the current events and write a bit about science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am quite happy with this jekyll based blog hosted on github. I mean, editing using a text editor, version control, and free hosting with unlimited customization ability. What more can one ask for?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess this is a good enough begining. More actual content to follow soon.&lt;/p&gt;
